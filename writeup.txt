=====================
Features Implemented:
=====================
1. The mesh of the pool was loaded along with its vertices and indices. The normals were computed for the vertices.
This was done by computing the normals of the triangles of the mesh. 
Then the average of the normals of triangles to which each vertex was associated was found out.

2. The object transformations on the pool were done and was rendered. The materials for the pool was set.

3. The camera was brought into position and configured. The lighting was enabled and configured.

3. OpenGL Depth test was enabled.

4. The heights of the water mesh was calculated. The vertex normals for the water mesh was calculated. 
This was done by first computing the normal of the quadrilaterals of the mesh. The normal of a quadilateral 
is the normalised cross product of its diagonals. Then, the average of normals of quadrilaterals to which each vertex 
was associated was calculated.

5. The object transformation for the water mesh was done. The materials for water was set. Ambience, Diffuse and Specular has been set for the pool and the mesh.

6. The water was rendered and now appears animated.

The screen shots have been provided as PNG files in the project root directory.
